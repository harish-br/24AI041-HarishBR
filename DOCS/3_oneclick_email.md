## Steps to create a workflow:
- Start with “On Form Submission” – when someone submits the form, the workflow begins.
- The form data is sent to the AI Agent node for processing.
- The AI Agent uses the Google Gemini Chat Model to generate a smart reply.
- The final AI-generated answer is passed to the Send a Message (Gmail) node.
- Gmail automatically sends the message to your email.
- Click Execute Workflow to test — you will see the result delivered to your inbox.
